<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I love this movie because the adventure is awesome and the story has the best ending (and twist) I ever watched.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>Tarantino movies always have a place in my heart. The dialogue, the acting, the story is just some of the best I ever watched. <br />
    Pulp Fiction takes the cake for my number one favorite Tarantino movies and second best movies of all time.</p>
