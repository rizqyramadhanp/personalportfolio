<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born December 23, 1999 in Surabaya, Indonesia</p>
<p>I just graduated from Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) as Bachelor of Engineering of Electrical Engineering. I graduated with 3,54 GPA.</p>

<p>I took Electronics as my field of study. I mastered Electrical Circuit, Embedded Electronics System, Programmable Logic Control (PLC), Machine Learning (Computer Vision, CNN), Firebase, Database (SQL) and Programming (Python C++,).</p>

<p>My first journey during my college is joining ITS Billiard. ITS Billiard is a Student Activity Unit that focuses on Billiard sports. I was once a Media and Information Staff in charge of social media and graphic design of every ITS Billiard activity. <br />
  And then I become a Laboratory Assistant in Microelectronics and Embedded System Laboratory ITS. The lab aims to help students understand electrical circuits and electronic circuits. I helped plan the practicum of Electrical Circuits and Electronic Circuits and was in charge of serving and assisting students who took practicum in this laboratory. <br />
  While being Laboratory Assistant, I also became LKMM ITS Trainer. LKMM is a training activity for students with the aim of improving their management skills. My experience as LKMM trainers are providing an understanding of lower-level students related to self-management and event management as well as providing understanding to prospective LKMM trainers. <br />
  After one year as LKMM Trainer, I was appointed as Chairman of LKMM FTEIC ITS Trainer and also Head of Trainer in BEM FTEIC ITS. My task is to coordinate each department within FTEIC to organize departmental and faculty-level LKMM. Then, my job is to be a bridge between BEM FTEIC and FTEIC LKMM Trainers.</p>
